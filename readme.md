## Course Planning Management System
 [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/laravel/framework/license.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)

The Course Planning Management System (CPMS) should support the course planning of department or faculty from early phases of the planning to scheduling the courses. The main focus of CPMS is to optimize the cooperative work between the involved persons throughout the whole process.

The Prototype was build as a part of a master thesis at the [Department of Informatics at the University of Hamburg](www.inf.uni-hamburg.de), to show how a web based software can support the cooperative work between different roles, reduce time effort, number of documents and trascription errors, and make the process more transparent.

The CPMS is based on the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com) v. 4.2 and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) v.3.*.
